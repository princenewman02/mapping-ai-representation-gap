## Project Overview

This project addresses the question: By building a hate speech detector, how can we measure performance disparities across demographic groups and identify which communities are underserved or over-policed? This is crucial as it aims to reveal potential algorithmic biases, ensuring that AI systems treat all demographic groups fairly and equitably. Identifying these disparities is vital for improving the accountability and transparency of AI technologies.

- **Objective:** Build a hate speech detector and measure performance disparities across demographic groups to identify which communities are underserved or over-policed  
- **Domain:** Bias in Artificial Intelligence 
- **Key Techniques:**

## Data

We will utilize the following datasets:

[Jigsaw Civil Comments (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data): Contains 2 million comments used to train the hate speech detector, featuring toxicity labels and identity mentions (race, religion, gender, disability).

[HateCheck (Paul Röttger GitHub)](https://github.com/paul-rottger/hatecheck-data): Provides 3,728 test cases for fairness benchmark testing, focusing on demographic variations.

[US Census 2020/2022](https://data.census.gov/): Offers demographic baseline comparisons, including population proportions by race, ethnicity, and disability.
